* What
  Minimal lisp interpreter in Lua. Trying to make one of these from
  time to time. It's very simplistic, ineficient and not even very
  lispish.
* Why Eva?
  Too Many Puns:
  - Extra-Vehicular Activity. Spacewalks
  - eva.lua is the name of the file. which in spanish means evaluate.
  - Eva lu Ator.

* Did you spend more time on the name than writing the actual interpreter?
  No, but I spent a fair amount of time

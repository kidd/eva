* What
  Minimal lisp interpreter in Lua. Trying to make one of these from
  time to time. It's very simplistic, ineficient and not even very
  lispish.
# * Why Eva?
#   Too Many Puns:
#   - Extra-Vehicular Activity. Spacewalks
#   - eva.lua is the name of the file. which in spanish means evaluate.
#   - Eva lu Ator.

* Did you spend more time on the name than writing the actual interpreter?
  No, but I spent a fair amount of time


* Examples
  - (define (fib x) (if (= x 1) 1 (* x (fib (- x 1)))))
    (fib 10) => 3628800
  - (define foo (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))
    (goo 41) => 42
